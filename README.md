# WiCoin : Wireless LAN Sharing Using Block Chain Technology


We proposes a blockchain system to share Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) that recently suffers from mutual interference among increasing devices using unlicensed bands. Blockchain technology can induce cooperation from users by incentivizing them with cryptocurrency like shown in Bitcoin example. In this paper, we describe Blockchain based access mechanism in WLAN instead of conventional authentication based access. Here, users can access any WLAN access point by paying through smart contract while they also receive payment from others. In order to support real-time transaction, we apply proof-of-authority that is realized by Byzantine fault tolerant protocol instead of well-known proof-of-work that requires huge computing power and delay.
